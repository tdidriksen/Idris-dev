When checking argument xs to constructor Data.Vect.:::
        Type mismatch between
                Vect (k + k) a (Type of vapp xs xs)
        and
                Vect (plus k m) a (Expected type)
        
        Specifically:
                Type mismatch between
                        plus k k
                and
                        plus k m

When checking right hand side of with block in Main.parity:
Type mismatch between
        Parity (plus (S j) (S j)) (Type of even)
and
        Parity (S (S (plus j j))) (Expected type)

Specifically:
        Type mismatch between
                plus (S j) (S j)
        and
                S (S (plus j j))
